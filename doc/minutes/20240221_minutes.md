# Meeting minutes 21.02.2024

This meeting was the kickoff of the PS6 project.

## Participants

* Noah Godel (Student)
* Frédéric Bapst (Supervisor)

## Decisions

* There are two major parts to the project:
    * Making an HTTP API that enables us to use a constraint solver "backend" (for example Google OR-Tools)
        * This API will be deployed on the schools k8s cluster
        * Security should be taken into consideration during the development of the API (authentication)
        * The API should be usable by multiple users (not block on every request)
    * Use the API in a prolog "library" to be able to use it for constraint programming
        * Prolog provides a simple-to-use HTTP client that allows us to query the API
        * The data we get from the API will be wrapped so that it can be used easily
        * The library shouldn't be too different to other constraint programming backends already present
* An architectural diagram showing the structure of the API and how it is deployed will be made for next week
* A usage example of the prolog library will be made to illustrate how the library will be structured will be made for next week
* On the basis of these two things the objectives of the project will be defined
