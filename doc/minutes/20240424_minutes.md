# Meeting minutes 24.04.2024

During this meeting the k8s deployment was discussed.

## Participants

* Noah Godel (Student)
* Frédéric Bapst (Supervisor)

## Decisions

* It is a detail that there is a ressource leak with the global list of constraints, but it is not a big deal (still mention it in the report).
* There is no need for persistance of the results, once read by the client the results can be deleted.
* For authentication there will be one admin with a password, that can create new tokens with an expiration date.
* A redis database will be used to store the tokens until they expire.
* Don't forget to add the solver timeout parameters in the client library.
* Important to explain a testing plan in the report and to have some implementation of it.
* Until the next meeting the code should be more or less finished, so that the focus can be on the report.
