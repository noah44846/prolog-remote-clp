# Meeting minutes 28.03.2024

During this meeting, we discussed the current state of the project after not having met for a while. We also discussed the design of the API and the client library.

## Participants

* Noah Godel (Student)
* Frédéric Bapst (Supervisor)

## Decisions

* Mr Bapst will create a Kubernetes project so a namespace can be created for the project.
* GNU Prolog has some example programs for CLP that could be used as demonstrations of project and to test the comapare the project to a native implementation.
* One of the demonstration programs should have a varaible that allows to increase the complexity of the problem so that performance can be compared.
* For the design part of the report, sequence diagrams should be used to show how the protocol works.
* Maybe a deployment diagram could be used to show how the API is structured on the kube cluster.
* Till next meeting (10.04), the report should be written up to the design part and the implementation of the API should be started.
