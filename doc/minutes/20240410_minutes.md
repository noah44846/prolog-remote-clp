# Meeting minutes 10.04.2024

During this meeting the first steps of the implementation were discussed as well as the analysis chapter.

## Participants

* Noah Godel (Student)
* Frédéric Bapst (Supervisor)

## Decisions

* Add references to previous work and specifications in the report.
* Add captions to the code snippets in the report and make references to the figures / listings.
* Add one more "operator" to the model for the initial prototype to show that it is possible to add more operators.
* Mention the solver settings in the report (which ones are needed etc.).
* It is ok to get the results in one block, there is non need to gradually send them to the client.
* There is no clear criteria if more logic should be on the server or on the client side. It is up to the student to decide what is best.
* Till the next meeting the student should have the first prototype ready.
