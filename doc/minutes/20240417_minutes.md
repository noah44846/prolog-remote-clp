# Meeting minutes 17.04.2024

During this meeting the first working prototype was discussed.

## Participants

* Noah Godel (Student)
* Frédéric Bapst (Supervisor)

## Decisions

* Instead of focusing on implementing further features the focus should lie in the k8s deployment and report.
* There is no need for running multiple solvers on the same worker, scaling with the number of workers is enough.
* Explain all the detail about what is supported by the client library (creating variables on the fly in constraints, labeling on a subset of the defined variables, etc).
